We live in a neighbourhood called Olskroken. When I was buying my appartment I chose this neighbourhood for it's dog-friendliness (before I even met Watson!).</p>\n<p><strong>What does a dog-friendly neighbourhood mean?</strong> From my point of view a neighbourhood can be called dog-friendly if it has the following attributes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A forest or a park</li>\n<li>An Animal Hospital</li>\n<li>A Dog Park (Called \"hundrasgarden\" in Swedish)</li>\n<li>Doggy Daycare (Called \"hunddagis\" in Swedish)</li>\n<li>A Pet Store</li>\n<li>A Pet Salon</li>\n<li>Dog-friendly cafes and restaurants</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is not necessary for a neighbourhood to have all the attributes mentioned above to be called dog-friendly but the more checkboxes it ticks the higher it would be on my list.</p>\n<p><strong>Now to the problem and goal of this project</strong>: I am looking into moving to Stockholm and I would like to find a dog-friendly area to live in. The goal of this project would be to determine and compare dog-friendly neighbourhoods in Stockholm.</p>\n<p>I believe the end results of this analysis would be beneficial to any dog owner living in Stockholm or someone who wants to move with their furry buddy to this city.</p>\n<p>I will be using Foursquare API to retrieve venue information and any data that I can scrape on the&nbsp;Wikipedia or the internet on the neighbourhoods of Stockholm.</p>"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":""}],"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2,"metadata":{"language_info":{"name":"python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3}},"orig_nbformat":2,"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","npconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":3}}
